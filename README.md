This XCode project is inspired by this video from [**Brian Advent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-f1KSPKm4I).

I have reimplemented his code in a 100% progrommatic style using AutoLayout and without using any Storyboard. Also, I made a few minor changes, for instance, unlike his code in which all the corners of the child view controller are rounded, I have only rounded the top left and right corners. 

Update (19/Jan/2020): the animation will be reversed/cancelled if the child view is not panned more than 30%.
